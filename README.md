# Plugin Release Deploy Action

This GitHub Action helps you release and deploy WordPress plugins using PHP and Node. It automates the entire process, from creating a release to deploying the plugin on WordPress.org.

## Description

This action does the following:
1. Creates a new release and generates a changelog.
2. Checks out your repository code.
3. Sets up the specified PHP and Node.js environments.
4. Installs the required PHP and Node.js dependencies.
5. Builds the plugin.
6. Uploads the built plugin as a zip file to the GitHub release.
7. Deploys the plugin to the WordPress.org SVN repository.

## Usage

To use this action, you need to add it to your GitHub Actions workflow file. Hereâ€™s a sample workflow file:

```yaml
name: ðŸš€ Deploy Release
on:
  pull_request:
    types:
      - closed
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  if_merged:
    if: github.event.pull_request.merged == true
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "The PR was merged"
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Deploy Release
        uses: devuri/plugin-release-deploy-action@main
        with:
          php-version: '7.4'
          node-version: '16'
          plugin-slug: 'your-plugin-slug' # WordPress.org plugin slug
          build-dir: './build/trunk/'
          zip-file: 'your-plugin.zip'
          svn-username: ${{ secrets.WP_SVN_USERNAME }}
          svn-password: ${{ secrets.WP_SVN_PASSWORD }}
          dry-run: 'false' # This is optional and defaults to 'false'
```

In this example:
- Replace `'your-plugin-slug'` with the slug of your WordPress plugin.
- Replace `'./build/trunk/'` with the directory where your plugin is built.
- Replace `'your-plugin.zip'` with the name of the zip file to upload.
- Add your WordPress.org SVN username and password to your repository secrets as `WP_SVN_USERNAME` and `WP_SVN_PASSWORD`.

## Example

Hereâ€™s a complete example for a plugin named `my-wordpress-plugin`:

```yaml
name: ðŸš€ Deploy Release
on:
  pull_request:
    types:
      - closed
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  if_merged:
    if: github.event.pull_request.merged == true
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "The PR was merged"
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Deploy Release
        uses: devuri/plugin-release-deploy-action@main
        with:
          php-version: '7.4'
          node-version: '16'
          plugin-slug: 'my-wordpress-plugin' # WordPress.org plugin slug
          build-dir: './build/trunk/'
          zip-file: 'my-wordpress-plugin.zip'
          svn-username: ${{ secrets.WP_SVN_USERNAME }}
          svn-password: ${{ secrets.WP_SVN_PASSWORD }}
          dry-run: 'false'
```

## Note

This action is an opinionated abstract of the functionalities of the [10up action](https://github.com/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-deploy) combined with Google's [release-please action](https://github.com/google-github-actions/release-please-action) for a streamlined deployment process. It may not be suitable for all use cases. For more flexibility, consider using the individual actions directly.
> For an example plugin structure that works well with this action, refer to the [Sample Plugin](https://github.com/devuri/shortcode-options).

## Assumptions

This action makes several assumptions about your plugin's structure and setup:
- **Composer Setup**: Your plugin uses Composer for PHP dependency management.
- **NPM Setup**: Your plugin uses NPM for Node.js dependency management and build scripts.
- **Build Directory**: The build directory (`build-dir`) contains the final plugin files ready to be deployed to WordPress.org.
- **Zip File**: The zip file (`zip-file`) is the name of the zip file that will be uploaded to the GitHub release.
- **SVN Access**: You have valid SVN credentials for WordPress.org stored in your repository secrets.
