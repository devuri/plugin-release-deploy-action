### Action Consumption and Cost

Using GitHub Actions in your workflows is a powerful way to automate your CI/CD processes, but it is important to be aware of the consumption and associated costs. GitHub Actions usage is billed based on the amount of compute time required to run your workflows, and this can vary depending on the runner used and the total minutes consumed.

#### Billing Overview

GitHub provides a certain amount of free minutes each month, depending on your plan. Here are the key points related to billing:

- **Free Minutes**: Each GitHub plan includes a certain amount of free minutes for GitHub Actions usage. For example, GitHub Free for public repositories provides unlimited minutes, whereas GitHub Free for private repositories includes 2,000 free minutes per month.
- **Billing for Additional Minutes**: If your usage exceeds the free minutes provided by your plan, you will be billed for the additional minutes. The cost per minute varies based on the type of runner used:
  - **Linux Runners**: $0.008 per minute
  - **macOS Runners**: $0.08 per minute
  - **Windows Runners**: $0.016 per minute

#### Monitoring Usage

You can monitor your GitHub Actions usage and billing through the GitHub interface:

1. **Navigate to Billing & plans**: Go to your GitHub organization's settings, then click on "Billing & plans".
2. **View Usage**: Under the "Actions" section, you can see the usage for the current billing cycle, including the number of minutes used and the cost incurred.

#### Cost Optimization Tips

To manage and optimize the cost of using GitHub Actions, consider the following tips:

- **Optimize Workflow Runs**: Ensure that your workflows are optimized to reduce unnecessary runs. For example, use conditional statements to avoid running workflows on every push or pull request if not necessary.
- **Use Self-Hosted Runners**: If you have significant usage, consider using self-hosted runners. Self-hosted runners can be run on your own infrastructure, which can help reduce the cost of using GitHub-hosted runners.
- **Efficient Steps**: Optimize the steps in your workflows to reduce the total run time. This can include caching dependencies, minimizing the number of steps, and using more efficient scripts.

#### Example Workflow Cost

The `Release Deployer` action workflow provided in this example uses an Ubuntu runner, which costs $0.008 per minute. For small projects, the `Release Deployer` workflow typically runs for about 1-2 minutes, including both the checkout and deployment steps. Here is an estimate of the costs associated with running this workflow:

- **Checkout and Deployment Steps**: Typically, the entire workflow, including checking out the code and deploying, might take around 1-2 minutes for small projects.

Assuming an average run time of 2 minutes per workflow run, the cost would be:

- **Linux Runner Cost**: $0.008 per minute * 2 minutes = $0.016 per run.

If you run this workflow 50 times in a month, the total cost would be:

- **Total Monthly Cost**: $0.016 per run * 50 runs = $0.80.

This is a rough estimate, and actual costs may vary based on the exact duration of each workflow run and the frequency of workflow executions.
